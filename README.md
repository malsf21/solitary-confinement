# solitary-confinement

Solitary Confinement is a web-app implementation of "[strategy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_(card_game))" solitaire. I quicky spun it up for a friend, mostly because online solitaire tends to only be [Klondike Solitaire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klondike_(solitaire)).

This app is built with [`react`](https://reactjs.org) and [`react-bootstrap`](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/); I bootstrapped it with [`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). The SVG playing cards are courtesy of [Adrian Kennard](https://www.me.uk/cards/).

## development setup

The steps are pretty typical for any Node project:

```sh
$ yarn install # or npm install
$ yarn start   # or yarn start
```
